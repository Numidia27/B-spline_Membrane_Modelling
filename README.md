### *Dynamic-Based Modelling of Surface and Volumetric Objects*

## Project Aim
To develop a **prototype application** for the **real-time modelling of membranes and elastic solids**
under applied forces.


## Overview
This project implements a physics‑informed C++ simulation framework for dynamic B‑spline surfaces
and deformable solids, enabling parameter‑driven, time‑dependent analysis of structural response under applied forces. </br>

The dynamics of the membranes are formulated using **Lagrangian mechanics**, where the
equations of motion are expressed in terms of B-spline control points. This formulation
leads to a system of **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, which is solved numerically
using the **finite difference method (FDM)**. 
The solver is implemented in **C++**, built upon an existing numerical computation library.
